# Bun - Hono - App

**Bun** is a all-in-one compiler that allows users to build applications with as minimal tools as possible. But but bun by itself is not sufficient to build scaliable web application with cross-platform, for this we are going to use hono, alpine.js, tailwindcss, and capacitor.js, we are also going to use docker to deploy our app on render.
